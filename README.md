# MonitorForgeX
MonitorForgeX is a small Bash utility for X11 setups using `xrandr` and i3wm (or any WM that reads Xresources).   It automatically detects connected monitors, arranges them left-to-right in a predictable order, exports monitor names and resolutions into `~/.Xresources`, and provides a simple rotate command that also refreshes your exports.
